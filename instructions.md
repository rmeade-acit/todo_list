# Student Todo List Project Guide

This guide outlines the requirements and planning process for completing the Todo List application. You've been provided with the HTML and CSS files, and now you need to create the JavaScript functionality to make the application work.

## Project Overview

You'll be creating the JavaScript code for a Todo List application. The application allows users to:
- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks
- Filter tasks by status (All, Active, Completed)
- Track the number of remaining tasks

## Documentation and Planning Requirements

### 1. Project Analysis

Start by analyzing the existing HTML and CSS code to understand:
- What elements exist in the DOM
- What functionality is expected based on the UI components
- What event listeners will be needed
- How data should be stored and manipulated

### 2. Data Structure Planning

Document your plan for storing todo items. Consider:
- What data structure will you use? (Array, object, etc.)
- What properties should each todo item have? (text, completion status, ID, etc.)
- How will you persist the data? (localStorage, session storage, or just in-memory)

### 3. Function Specifications

Create detailed specifications for each function you'll implement:

### 4. Pseudocode

Write pseudocode for the major functions before implementing them. For example:

### 5. Implementation Plan

Create a step-by-step implementation plan:

1. Set up data structures and variables
2. Implement core functionality:
   - Adding todos
   - Rendering todo list
   - Toggling completion status
   - Deleting todos
3. Implement filtering functionality
4. Implement count tracking
5. Add localStorage for persistence (if required)
6. Test and debug

### 6. Testing Plan

Develop a testing checklist for your application:

- [ ] Adding a todo adds it to the list
- [ ] Completing a todo updates its appearance
- [ ] Deleting a todo removes it from the list
- [ ] Filtering shows only relevant todos
- [ ] Counter accurately reflects remaining todos
- [ ] Data persists after page reload (if implemented)
- [ ] Input validation works correctly
- [ ] Edge cases are handled properly

### 7. Documentation

Document your code with:

- Clear, descriptive comments
- Function headers explaining purpose, parameters, and return values
- Explanations of complex logic
- Information about any data structures used

## Submission Requirements

Your final submission should include:

1. The completed JavaScript file (script.js)
2. A documentation file containing:
   - Your data structure design
   - Function specifications
   - Pseudocode for key functions
   - Implementation decisions and rationale
   - Any challenges faced and how you overcame them
   - Future enhancements you would make

Remember that this project emphasizes documentation and planning, so focus on providing clear, thorough explanations of your thought process and approach.
